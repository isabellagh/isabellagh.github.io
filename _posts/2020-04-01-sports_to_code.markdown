On a warm night of july 2019 was born the love of my life, my son, and the main reason i decided to change from being a Personal Trainer, soccer coach, and pre-k teacher assistant to a software developer. I want to be able to spend some more quality time with him and be able to provide what he needs finantialy.
I have always liked computer. when I was a teen I took a lot of classes about computer (word, excell, building pc, etc.) and i did not even have a computer. 

Since computer sciece was not a big thing in my city back then and the university did not have the course I choose to be a PE teacher and Personal trainer. 
Unfortunately I did not adapt/liked very much to work with that, even though i love sports. it is just very different from enjoyng exercising and helping people to exercise, specially when clients do not like it or do not follow what you planned.

So a friend of mine told me about computer programing and how I would have a possibility to work from home, building websites and apps. I started to dig in about it and I joined some free courses online, like Udemy and free code camp and I really liked it. After a lot of researching i finaly made my mind of changing career and go to technology. I like coding, trying to fix them, even though i create more bugs than fix them so far. But the challenge of the "puzzle" coding just makes me feel good about myself and with the feeling of ill never stop learning.
